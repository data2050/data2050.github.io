### Course Overview

Students work with a practicum supervisor in industry—typically during an internship—or an academic researcher—typically as part of an ongoing research program—and solve a real-world data problem which exercises the skills developed in the program. Students will submit a proposal, weekly status reports, and a final paper and presentation. To receive credit the project must entail at least 180 hours of work and typically takes between 5 and 12 weeks to complete.
